# EDA-on-Electronic-Product-Sales-Forecast
Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an electronic sales dataset using Python. The analysis focuses on customer demographics, product performance, sales trends, payment methods, and shipping preferences. Interactive visualizations and statistical summaries provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

üìÇ Project Structure
Dataset:
A CSV file (Electronicsales.csv) containing sales transaction data with details like product type, price, ratings, customer demographics, purchase date, and payment/shipping methods.
Python Script:
EDA PROJECT 1 ON ELECTRONIC SALES.py
Implements data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries.

üéØ Objectives
Analyze customer demographics (age, gender, loyalty membership).
Evaluate product performance (sales and ratings by product type).
Assess order status, payment methods, and shipping preferences.
Visualize sales trends over time to identify growth opportunities.

üöÄ Key Features
1. Customer Demographics:
Age group analysis using box plots.
Gender distribution and loyalty membership using count plots.
2. Product Performance:
Bar charts to evaluate sales and ratings across product types.
3. Order Status and Preferences:
Order status distribution using count plots.
Payment methods and shipping types visualized using pie charts.
4. Sales Trend Analysis:
Monthly and yearly sales trends visualized using line plots and bar charts.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language for data analysis.
Libraries Used:
numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
üìà Key Insights
1. Customer Demographics:
Majority of customers fall within the 35-65 age group.
Male customers dominate the dataset, and most customers are non-loyalty members.
2. Product Performance:
Smartphones, Smartwatches, and Laptops contribute the most to sales revenue.
Product ratings vary widely, with clear patterns by product type.
3. Order and Payment Preferences:
Most orders are successfully delivered, with credit card as the most preferred payment method.
Standard shipping is the most commonly chosen shipping option.
4. Sales Trends:
Clear monthly and yearly trends show peak sales periods.
